Billiards Analytics and Learning System

The Billiards Analytics and Learning System (BALS) is an experimental set up that leverages a Boston-based company's billiards table as the source of an accessible and rich data set.  The goal of this system is to provide a data and analytics sandbox that data geeks can use to expand their analytical skills, explore and try new ideas, develop visualizations, integrate mobile technology, and whatever else they dream up.
