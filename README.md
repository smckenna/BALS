Billiards Analytics and Learning System

The Billiards Analytics and Learning System (BALS) is an experimental set up that leverages the Boston Officeâ€™s billiards table as the source of an accessible and rich data set.  The goal of this system is to provide a data and analytics sandbox that Booz Allen staff can use to expand their analytical skills, explore and try new ideas, develop visualizations, integrate mobile technology, and whatever else they dream up.
